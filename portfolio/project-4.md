Predicting ICU Requirement for patients being tested Covid-19 positive or even before is the need of the hour. In this regard, this is a simple predictive modelling project to render insights and analysis of Patient's Condition.

Using theÂ [Kaggle Covid19 patient pre-condition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tanmoyx/covid19-patient-precondition-dataset), the tool provides real-time training and testing. The inner dynamics consist of data cleaning, visualizing and selecting the most relevant independent features for ICU requirement prediction. Subsequently the training is done on the Logistic Regression Model for quick results.

Tools: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS
